Topogram is an open-source web toolkit to map social, semantic and spatio-temporal dynamics. It answers the growing need for interactive mapping of complex online and offline interactions.

The software is divided into 2 parts : 1) a Python mining library and webserver to extract networks of words, citations and places from text data and 2) a collaborative visualization interface to edit, annotate and publish graphs.

For more about the project, see [How It Works](/HowItWorks) or read the [FAQ](/faq)

Topogram was created by [Cl√©ment Renaud](http://clementrenaud.com) in 2014.
